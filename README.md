# QuantLab Factor Library

QuantLab Factor Library is a plug‑and‑play toolkit for building and evaluating equity factor signals on top of the cleaned outputs from the data pipeline. It loads wide price/sector data and Fama‑French benchmarks, computes forward returns, and provides 50+ prebuilt factors across momentum, reversal, volatility/tail risk, liquidity/flow, value, quality, growth, capital actions, estimates/events, and forensic integrity. Each factor subclasses a common FactorBase, runs its raw computation, and then passes through a standardized cleaning pipeline (coverage filter, winsorization, fill, sector/global neutralization, z‑score) with overrides via config/config.json.

The runner supports modular steps: compute factors (optionally in parallel), run analytics (IC/IR, decile monotonicity, LS Sharpe/DD with FF regressions), compute cross-factor and FF correlations, and generate rolling IC/IR time effects. Outputs are written to data/factors as long-format Parquet (one file per factor and LS PnL), with registry and correlation files plus CSV mirrors in diagnostics for quick inspection. Two notebooks (factor_demo, factor_parallel_demo) show the full workflow and how to rerun analytics without recomputing factors. Use the default catalog or extend it by adding new factor classes and tuning cleaning/neutralization per factor.

## Quickstart
- Configure paths in `config/config.json` if needed (`data_root`, `final_dir`, `factors_dir`); defaults point to `../data`.
- Factor cleaning defaults can also be tweaked in `config/config.json` under `factor_defaults` (winsor_limits, min_coverage, fill_method, neutralize_method); per-factor calls can still override.
- Create env: `conda env create -f quantlab_env/environment.yml` (includes numpy, pandas, pyarrow, scipy, etc.).
- Run default factors:  
  `python -m quantlab_factor_library.run_factors`
- Example : [`notebooks/factor_parallel_demo.ipynb`](notebooks/factor_parallel_demo.ipynb)
- Cleaning defaults and per-factor overrides can be tweaked in `config/config.json` (`factor_defaults` and `factor_overrides`, including forward_fill flags for fundamentals); per-factor calls can still override in code.

## Modular run steps
You no longer need to run end-to-end every time:
- `compute_factors(parallel=False, max_workers=4)`: compute/clean factors, save factor files and LS PnL; returns factors, ls_returns, ff, fwd_returns.
- `run_analytics_only(factors, fwd_returns, ff=None)`: IC/IR, LS stats, FF regression; writes diagnostics/registry.
- `compute_correlations_only(factors, ls_returns=None, ff=None)`: factor cross-corr and LS vs FF correlation.
- `run_time_effects(factors, fwd_returns, window=252, step=21)`: rolling IC/IC IR over time.
Use the notebooks to see the sequence; re-run analytics/correlations/rolling without recomputing factors.

## Outputs
- Factors: `../data/factors/factor_<name>.parquet` (long format: Date, Ticker, Value).
- Registry: `../data/factors/factor_analytics_summary.parquet` (mean IC, IC t-stat, IC IR, mean autocorr, decile spread, LS stats, FF alpha/betas).
- Correlation: `../data/factors/factor_correlation.parquet` (and FF corr) with CSV mirrors in `diagnostics/` for quick inspection.
- FF time series: `../data/factors/factor_ff_timeseries.parquet` for benchmarking/orthogonalization.

## Default cleaning/neutralization (used by `compute` and the notebook)
- Coverage filter (drop dates with <30% non-NaN coverage).
- Winsorize (1st/99th pct).
- Fill (cross-sectional median).
- Sector neutralization. (sector de-mean)
- Z-score cross-sectionally. (stock selection alpha instead of global alpha overlay)
- drop all-NaN dates.

## Extending
- Build new factors by subclassing `FactorBase` or parameterizing existing classes (e.g., Momentum with different lookback/skip).
- Use FF factors for benchmarking/orthogonalization via `load_ff_factors()` and `regress_on_ff`.
- FF regression uses lightweight OLS (numpy + scipy for p-values) to keep the pipeline lean.
